  "summary": "This repository, named \u201cnnamdiodozi-gh_summariser,\u201d is a Python-based tool designed to ingest and summarize GitHub repositories, primarily through the use of the `gitingest` utility and an accompanying FastAPI backend. The project is structured around two main components: a CLI-driven ingestion script (`main.py`) that downloads and processes GitHub content, and an API layer (`api/`) built with FastAPI to expose summarization capabilities over HTTP. The codebase is written in Python 3.12, as specified in `.python-version`, and leverages modern async patterns and dependency management via `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. While the README.md file is sparse and appears to be placeholder content (\u201cGitingest to be downloaded on the server\u201d), the actual code and structure reveal a more sophisticated tool that integrates with the Doubleword Batch API for scalable LLM inference, suggesting the summarization may involve AI-powered text generation or extraction. The presence of `CLAUDE.md` and `doublewordai-batch-skill.txt` indicates this tool may be intended for use within Claude Code or similar AI agent environments that support skills-based workflows. The repository\u2019s structure and dependencies suggest it is under active development, with some modules like `api/routes/chat.py` referencing undefined types (`types.Content`, `types.Part`, `runner.run_async`) that imply integration with an external agent framework not fully included in this repo.\n\nKey features include:\n- CLI-driven GitHub repository ingestion via `gitingest` with support for branch specification, token authentication, and file size limits.\n- FastAPI backend (`api/main.py`) exposing `/api/v1/chat` and `/api/v1/health` endpoints for programmatic access.\n- Integration with Doubleword Batch API for cost-effective, high-throughput LLM inference, as detailed in `CLAUDE.md` and `doublewordai-batch-skill.txt`.\n- Modular structure with separate routes for chat, sessions, and auth (though only chat is implemented).\n- Dependency management via `pyproject.toml` with `fastapi`, `python-dotenv`, and `PyGithub`.\n- Environment configuration via `.env.claude` and `settings.local.json` for Claude Code agent permissions.\n\nTo run or use:\n- Install dependencies using `uv sync` or `pip install -e .` after cloning.\n- Set up a GitHub personal access token in `.env.claude` under `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.\n- Run the CLI script with `python main.py` to ingest a specific GitHub repo (currently hardcoded to `https://github.com/doublewordai/batch-skill/tree/main`).\n- Start the API server with `uvicorn api.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001`.\n- Send POST requests to `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/chat` with `message`, `session_id`, and `user_id` parameters (though the underlying agent logic is not fully implemented here).\n\nRepo structure and stats:\n- Languages: Python (primary), with no other languages detected.\n- File counts: 16 files across 2 directories (`api/` and root).\n- Bytes read: Approximately 3.5 MB total, dominated by `uv.lock` (2.5 MB) and `CLAUDE.md` (1.1 MB).\n- Structure: Root contains `main.py`, `pyproject.toml`, config files, and `api/` directory with FastAPI modules.\n\nQuality signals:\n- Tests: No test files or directories found (e.g., no `tests/`, `test_*.py`, or `pytest.ini`).\n- CI: No CI configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `circle.yml`) present.\n- Docs: Minimal documentation; README is placeholder, `api/README.md` states \u201cyet to be tested or used.\u201d\n- Licenses: No `LICENSE` file found; while `doublewordai-batch-skill.txt` references MIT, it is not present in this repo.\n\nIntended audience / use cases:\n- AI agent developers using Claude Code or similar platforms that support skills.\n- Users needing to summarize or process GitHub repositories at scale using batched LLM inference.\n- Teams integrating GitHub content ingestion into internal tools or dashboards via the FastAPI endpoint.\n- Developers seeking to prototype AI-powered repository analysis with cost-efficient inference via Doubleword.\n\nClear unknowns:\n- The actual summarization logic is not implemented in this repo; `main.py` only downloads content, and `api/routes/chat.py` references undefined agent components.\n- The relationship between this repo and the `doublewordai/batch-skill` repo is unclear \u2014 it appears to be a dependency or inspiration, but not a direct fork.\n- The purpose of `prompt.txt` is ambiguous; it contains a template for generating summaries but is not invoked by any code.\n- The `api/routes/sessions.py` and `api/routes/auth.py` modules are referenced but not present in the codebase.\n- The intended behavior of the API endpoints beyond `/health` is speculative due to missing implementation details.\n- Whether this tool is meant to be used standalone or only within a Claude Code agent environment is not specified."
