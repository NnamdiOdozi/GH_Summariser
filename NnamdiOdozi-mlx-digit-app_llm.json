  "summary": "**Summary of the GitHub Repository: nnamdiodozi-mlx-digit-app**\n\nThis repository hosts a web application for recognizing handwritten digits (0\u20139) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The application is built primarily with **Python**, leveraging **PyTorch** for the neural network and **Streamlit** for the web interface. The app allows users to draw digits on a canvas, and the model predicts the digit, displaying the result along with confidence. Users can provide feedback by entering the correct digit if the prediction is wrong. Predictions are logged into a PostgreSQL database, and a PGAdmin interface is provided for viewing the logs. The project uses **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerization, with three containers: one for the Streamlit app, one for the PostgreSQL database, and one for PGAdmin. The app is deployed to a Hetzner VPS via GitHub Actions, which triggers a deployment script on push to the main branch. The repository includes a `requirements.txt` file specifying dependencies, a `Dockerfile` for building the app image, and a `docker-compose.yaml` file for orchestrating the containers. The project structure includes a `tests` directory with unit tests for the model and preprocessing functions, and a `db` directory with SQL scripts for database initialization. The `README.md` and `README.html` files provide project details, including deployment instructions and a description of the model architecture. The repository also includes a `runtests.py` script for running the test suite and a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file for development in Visual Studio Code.\n\n**Key Features (bullets):**\n- **Digit Recognition App**: A Streamlit-based web interface where users can draw digits and receive predictions.\n- **CNN Model**: A PyTorch-based Convolutional Neural Network trained on the MNIST dataset, with pre-trained weights included.\n- **Database Integration**: Predictions are stored in a PostgreSQL database with a `prediction_logs` table.\n- **Containerization**: Uses Docker and Docker Compose for deployment, with separate containers for the app, database, and PGAdmin.\n- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions automates deployment to a Hetzner VPS via SSH.\n- **Testing**: Includes unit tests for model and preprocessing logic in the `tests` directory.\n\n**How to run / use (2\u20135 bullets):**\n1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.\n2. Run `docker-compose up --build` to start the application, database, and PGAdmin containers.\n3. Access the app at `http://localhost:8501` (or the specified port).\n4. Draw a digit on the canvas and click \"Recognise\" to get a prediction.\n5. Enter the correct digit if the prediction is wrong and click \"Submit Feedback\" to update the database.\n\n**Repo structure (short) incl stats: { languages, file_counts, bytes_read }**\n- **Languages**: Python (90%), SQL (5%), Dockerfile (3%), HTML (1%), Other (1%).\n- **File counts**: 24 files.\n- **Bytes read**: Approximately 1.5 MB (including binary files like MNIST data and model weights).\n\n**Quality signals (tests/CI/docs), anything that is missing eg licences**\n- **Tests**: Unit tests for model and preprocessing functions are included in the `tests` directory.\n- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) automates deployment to a VPS.\n- **Documentation**: README.md and README.html provide project overview and deployment instructions.\n- **Missing**: No explicit license file (e.g., MIT, Apache) is present. No detailed API documentation or user guides beyond the README. No code quality tools (e.g., linters, static analyzers) are configured.\n\n**Intended audience / use cases**\n- **Intended audience**: Developers and data scientists interested in building and deploying machine learning web applications.\n- **Use cases**: Demonstrating a full-stack ML application using PyTorch, Streamlit, and Docker; educational purposes for teaching ML deployment; a starting point for building similar digit recognition apps.\n\n**Clear unknowns (what you could not infer)**\n- The exact model architecture (e.g., layer details, number of parameters) is not fully described in the code.\n- The reason for using `torch==2.0.1+cpu` (instead of a more recent version) is not clear.\n- The specific configuration of the Hetzner VPS (e.g., OS, hardware) is not detailed.\n- The purpose of the `runtests.py` script is unclear; it appears to run tests and log results, but its role in the CI/CD pipeline is not specified.\n- The reason for the `__init__.py` files in the `app` and `tests` directories is not evident, as they are empty.\n- The `data` directory contains raw MNIST files, but their origin and how they are used (e.g., downloaded vs. included) is not fully explained."
