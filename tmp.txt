  "summary": "**Summary of the GitHub Repository: nnamdiodozi-mlx-digit-app**\n\nThis repository hosts a web application for recognizing handwritten digits (0–9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The application is built using Python, with the core framework being **Streamlit** for the web interface, **PyTorch** for the CNN model, and **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage of prediction logs. The app allows users to draw a digit on a canvas, receive a prediction, and provide feedback if the prediction is incorrect. The prediction history and accuracy are displayed in a table, and all logged predictions are stored in a PostgreSQL database. The app is containerized using Docker and deployed via Docker Compose on a Hetzner VPS. The repository includes a pre-trained model (`mnist_cnn.pth`) and supports retraining via the `CNNModelMNIST.py` script. The codebase is structured to support development, testing, and deployment, with a focus on reproducibility and scalability.\n\n**Key Features**  \n- **Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit, enabling users to draw digits and receive real-time predictions.  \n- **CNN Model**: A PyTorch-based CNN trained on MNIST, with a pre-trained model included (`mnist_cnn.pth`).  \n- **Persistent Storage**: Prediction logs (timestamp, prediction, confidence, actual) are stored in a PostgreSQL database.  \n- **Dockerized Deployment**: Uses Docker Compose to manage three containers: the Streamlit app, PostgreSQL database, and PGAdmin.  \n- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions automates deployment to a VPS via SSH on pushes to the `main` branch.  \n- **Testing Framework**: Includes unit tests for model output and image preprocessing logic.  \n- **Data Handling**: MNIST dataset files are included in the repository for local use.  \n\n**How to Run / Use**  \n1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.  \n2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed, then run `docker-compose up -d` to start the app, database, and PGAdmin.  \n3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8501` (or the VPS IP if deployed).  \n4. Draw a digit on the canvas and click \"Recognise\" to see the prediction.  \n5. Submit feedback by entering the correct digit and clicking \"Submit Feedback\" to update the actual value in the database.  \n\n**Repo Structure**  \nThe repository is organized into the following directories:  \n- `app/`: Contains the Streamlit application, model, and data.  \n- `db/`: Includes SQL scripts for database initialization and table creation.  \n- `tests/`: Houses unit tests for the model and preprocessing functions.  \n- `.github/workflows/`: Contains the GitHub Actions workflow for deployment.  \n- `.devcontainer/`: Configures a development environment in VS Code.  \n- Root: Includes configuration files like `docker-compose.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md`.  \n**Stats**:  \n- **Languages**: Python (85%), Shell (10%), SQL (5%).  \n- **File Count**: 28 files.  \n- **Bytes Read**: ~120 KB (excluding binary files).  \n\n**Quality Signals**  \n- **Tests**: Unit tests are present for model output shape and image preprocessing.  \n- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow automates deployment via SSH to a VPS.  \n- **Documentation**: README includes usage instructions and project structure.  \n- **Missing**: No license file is present. No detailed documentation on model architecture or training parameters.  \n\n**Intended Audience / Use Cases**  \nThis repository is intended for developers and data scientists interested in deploying a machine learning model in a web application. It serves as a practical example of integrating PyTorch with Streamlit, managing persistent data with PostgreSQL, and automating deployment via Docker and GitHub Actions. It is suitable for educational purposes, prototyping, or as a foundation for a more complex digit recognition system.  \n\n**Clear Unknowns**  \n- The exact architecture of the CNN model (e.g., layer details) is not described in the README.  \n- The training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, optimizer settings) are not specified.  \n- The purpose of the `utils.py` file is not elaborated beyond image preprocessing.  \n- The `runtests.py` script is present but its role in the testing workflow is unclear.  \n- The repository does not include a license, making usage rights ambiguous.  \n- The `README.html` file is outdated and not reflective of the current repository state.  \n- The `app/data/MNIST/raw/` directory contains raw MNIST files, but their origin and inclusion policy are not explained.  \n- The `db/init.sql` script references `DB_PASSWORD` as a variable, but no secure method for managing this variable is documented.  \n- The `main.py` script includes a `load_dotenv()` call, but the `.env` file is not included, making environment configuration unclear.  \n- The `app/Dockerfile` installs PyTorch with CPU support, but no GPU support is provided.  \n- The `app/main.py`
